# Introduction to Deep Learning

Relu graph is 0 then for positive number it is linearly proportional.

Introduction to what a neural network looks like.

### Supervised Learning with Neural networks

Gives information on SUpervised learning.

Structured data - Tables
unstructured data - Music, image

### Why is deep learning taking off

Deep nn just progres so well, because of 

1. Data 
2. Computation
3. Algorithm

m denotes number of samples.

### About this course
